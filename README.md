# Abalones

The use of artificial intelligence and linear regression allows us to evaluate models on data sets to test their efficiency. For this project I will be using this model in order to try and determine the sex of abalones based on the data set provided. Ill be showing from start o finish how I got the data, why I chose linear regression as the best model, which features ion the data are most important, and whether or not the model overall is good for predicting abalone gender. There will be diagrams as well which will display my findings.
